# LlamaVision

A simple webapp which should show the usecase of data extraction with open source models.

The original creator of this full stack application is tiagolo

We stripped some services and added nextjs as a frontend application
You can run the application `docker compose up -w` everything should work out of the box on linux. On mac it seems that the extraction library `docling` seems not to work.
